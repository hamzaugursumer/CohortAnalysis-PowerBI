## **ðŸ“ŒWhat is Cohort Analysis and Why Is It Done?**

* Cohort analysis is a data analysis method used to group customers, users, or any set of individuals based on a specific characteristic or behavior, and to track and analyze their performance over time.
* Cohorts are created by bringing together individuals or objects with similar attributes, typically representing those who had a similar experience during a certain period.
* Cohort analysis is widely utilized in fields such as marketing, customer management, user experience optimization, and business strategy development.
  * The primary reasons for conducting cohort analysis are as follows:
  * **Monitoring Customer Behavior:** Understanding which customer groups engaged with a business during a specific period and assessing the outcomes helps a business gain insights into customer behavior.
  * **Loyalty Analysis:** Examining the likelihood of customers remaining loyal to a business over a certain period and assessing their loyalty levels.
  * **Product Development:** Identifying which products are preferred by specific cohorts, guiding the development of new products.
  * **Optimizing Marketing Strategies:** Understanding which marketing campaigns are more effective for specific cohorts can help in optimizing marketing strategies.
 
 ## **ðŸ“ŒTo perform cohort analysis, you can follow the fundamental steps:**

* **Cohort Definition:** The first step is to define the cohorts you want to analyze. These cohorts are typically composed of users with similar sign-up dates or a specific behavior.
* **Data Collection:** Collect the relevant data and organize it based on the defined cohorts. Data sources may vary depending on your business goals and the topic you want to analyze.
* **Tracking Cohort Performance:** Determine specific metrics or KPIs to track the performance of each cohort over time. These metrics might include revenue, conversion rates, or retention rates.
* **Analysis of Results:** Compare the performance of cohorts and try to understand which groups are more successful or which factors influence performance.
* **Strategy Development:** Based on the analysis results, take actions to improve or optimize your business strategies. For instance, you may focus more on successful cohorts or target specific cohorts more effectively.

## **ðŸ“ŒSteps applied from the power query phase**

* The 'Invoice' and 'StockCode' columns were converted to text, and canceled invoices, which are the ones starting with the letter "C," were not included in the process.
````
= Table.SelectRows(#"Filtered Rows", each not Text.StartsWith([Invoice], "C"))
````
* The 'InvoiceDate' column was converted to the Date data type.
* The 'Quantity' and 'Price' columns were multiplied, resulting in a new column named 'SalesAmount'.
````
= Table.AddColumn(#"Changed Type1", "SalesAmonunt", each [Quantity] * [Price], Currency.Type)
````
* There are 0 values in the 'SalesAmount' column. We are not including these values in the analysis as they have no relevance or represent any discounts or other specific circumstances.
* We are selecting the columns to continue our operations using the 'Choose Column' menu tool.
  * (Quantity,InvoiceDate,Price,CustomerID,Country,SalesAmount)
* The dataset contains two sheets for the years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011, but we have combined these sheets and conducted an analysis.

````
Active Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(FactSales[CleanedData.Customer ID])

New Customers = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Active Customers],
        FactSales[Month Since First Transaction] = 0
    )

Retention Rate = 
    DIVIDE([Cohort Performance],[New Customers])

VAR MaxDate = MAX(DimDate[Start of Month])
Return
    CALCULATE(
            [Active Customers],
            REMOVEFILTERS(DimDate[Start of Month]),
            RELATEDTABLE(DimCustomer),
            DimCustomer[First Transaction Month]>=MinDate 
                && DimCustomer[First Transaction Month]<=MaxDate

## **ðŸ“ŒHow to read a cohort analysis chart?**

* This dataset belongs to a UK-based company with wholesale customers. It spans over three years, and cohorts have been examined on a monthly basis.
* When we look at the row with the months, the month marked as 0 represents the first-time customers for the company.
* When we examine the 0 column, we observe the count of new customers acquired in consecutive months.
* For example, in December 2009, the company gained 955 new customers.
* When we look at this consecutively, we are tracking a declining trend in acquiring new customers.
* Therefore, the company should take actions to improve customer acquisition.
